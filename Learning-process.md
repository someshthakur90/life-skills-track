# Learning Process 

## Feynman Technique
Explain complex topics in a simplified manner and relearn if unable to explain.

## The most interesting idea from the video

Pomodoro technique -> Study for a fixed time and then take a break.

## Active and Diffused Modes of Learning
Active mode thinking occurs when we are focussed and generally know that concept already while diffused mode is a bit relaxed state of thinking and generally occurs when we learn new concepts.
## Steps for learning a new topic
* Deconstruct the skills 
* Learn to self-correct 
* Remove practice barriers 
* Practice at least 20 hours

## Actions that can improve my Learning Process

* Practice more than researching theory or at least practice for 20 hours minimum.
* Incorporate the Feynman technique.
