# Data warehousing
## What is it? 

### A Data warehouse is defined as the single source of Data Truth.

Suppose an employee is working with an Excel file and he creates a new version of the same file and edits it. And, another employee does the same thing, and so on. Thus it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to find which is the correct data. Thus the best quality data are kept in the data warehouse. The data is collected from multiple heterogeneous sources like DBMS, files, etc

## Features of Data Warehouse

1. Subject - Oriented 
2. Integrated
3. Time - variant
4. Non - volatile
5. Summarized
   
### Subject-Oriented
---
The data in the data warehouse is related to a subject for example, a corporation will store the data related to its employees and not some random data.

### Integrated 
---
The Data warehouse collects data from multiple sources and creates a unified form thus reducing data inconsistency.

### Time - variant
---
The warehouse also stores past data meaning, a corporation will store the information of an employee who has worked in the past.

### Non - volatile 
---
The data in the warehouse can't be deleted, or altered.

### Summarized
---
The data is organized in parts for analysis and reporting.

## Conclusion

The Data warehouse is used when we need to filter out the best quality data from multiple data sources and use that data to perform better quality analysis.
